                <h6 class="text-capitalize text-left"><kbd>Kendriya Vidyalaya Sanathan No.2 School Campus</kbd></h6>
                <p class="text-muted tex-left">The Kendriya Vidyalayas are a system of central government schools in India that were instituted under the aegis of the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD). It comprises over 1,094 schools in India and three abroad. It is one of world's largest chain of schools.

The system came into being in 1963 under the name 'Central Schools'. Later, the name was changed to Kendriya Vidyalaya. All the schools are affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). Its objective is to educate children of the Indian Defence Services personnel who are often posted to remote locations. With the army starting its own Army Public Schools, the service was extended (but not restricted) to all central government employees.

A uniform curriculum is followed by these schools all over India. By providing a common syllabus and system of education, the Kendriya Vidyalayas are intended to ensure that the children of government employees do not face education disadvantages when their parents are transferred from one location to another. The schools have been operational for more than 50 years.

The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, which literally translates to 'Central School Organisation', oversees the functioning of the schools with its headquarters in New Delhi.

The administration of this body is based on levels. The chairman of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan is always the Minister in Charge of Human Resource Development of the Government of India; the deputy chairman is Minister of State of MHRD. The real working power lies with the Commissioner of KVS; there are additional commissioners to accompany Commissioner in the administration of KVS in different fields. The head of a KVS region is Deputy Commissioner accompanied by an Assistant Commissioner. There are individual principals of every KV administrating the schools along with a Vice-Principal, Head Master/ Mistress.

The Vidyalaya also has several committees for the holistic development of the students and well maintenance of the school compound and system. The most important one is the VMC (Vidyalaya Management Committee), which is the head of all committees.</p>

      <h6 class="text-capitalize text-left"><kbd> Art and craft</kbd></h6>
     <p class="text-muted text-left">Arts and crafts can be described as creation or imagination of ideas that are brought to reality by developing naturally inherited skill set that exists among people of any age group. Students are provided extreme liberty by the tutor at arts and craft classes to select the colours and materials of their choice, especially when creating, drawing or developing a piece of artwork and filling colours to it. Arts and crafts classes in Kendriya Vidyalaya No 2 raipur Dd nagar help improve decision making capabilities of students, foster their creative development skills and help them advance and refine their core skills. This boosts their confidence and has a positive impact on their academic achievements. These classes help students pursue their hobbies and augment their critical thinking, reasoning, understanding, learning, and memorising abilities immensely. Students interested in learning drawing skills are taught about the correct posture to hold a paintbrush, pencils or markers. The ones keen towards learning sculptures are taught to build their hand muscles while playing with clay as this is a more physically-demanding form of art. With a free hand provided at arts and crafts classes, students develop their artistic skills, learn to focus on achieving their goals, and become self-leaners by constantly challenging their skills. Through arts and craft classes students learn to work creatively like an artist. They also learn to identify things that appeal their artistic skills and influence the final look of the product, drawing or art created by them.</p>

Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
2. Economics Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
3. Productivity / Efficiency Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
